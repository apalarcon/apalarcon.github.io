# Abstract
Extratropical cyclones (ECs) are a major phenomenon characterising mid-latitude weather and regional
climatic conditions. The ECs formed or developed over the North Atlantic play a determinant role in the
hydrological cycle of regions such as Western Europe. The Iberian Peninsula (IP) is often affected by extreme
cyclone-related hydrometeorological events. For the period 1985-2014, FLEXPART-WRF simulations forced
with ERA5 were used to investigate the anomalous moisture uptake (AMU) related to landfalling ECs over the IP.
The landfall was assumed when any point within the radius of the EC matched with an IP land mask grid. We
performed our analysis in terms of hydrological years and their classification into extremely wet, wet and normal,
following four quantile precipitation criteria (40%, 60%, 80%). Our results highlight a larger number of days in
which the IP was under the cyclonic influence (EC centre or radial area over land) for both wet and extremely wet
hydrological years. The analysis of the cyclone features for an entire life cycle of up to 7 days revealed that the
maximum winds varied between 60 and 72.5 m/s; meanwhile, for a lifetime greater than 48 h, the radius ranged
between 550 and 600 km, with smaller dimensions for normal hydrological years. In addition, during wet and
normal hydrological years the evolution of the central mean sea level pressure shows two minimums reaching
between 50 and 100 hours, more deepened for wet period cyclones. Strictly for the cyclone landfall time-steps,
annual EC-related positive AMU for wet and normal periods exhibits higher values near the landfall region, in
agreement with the local convergence of water vapour along the pathways. Nevertheless, the widespread
evaporative pattern over the North Atlantic, extended to the western coast, denotes the importance of these
moisture sources for EC-related precipitation. Principally, the annual wet period was characterized by a
displacement of the AMU inner lower central North Atlantic, Western Mediterranean and Cantabrian Sea.
