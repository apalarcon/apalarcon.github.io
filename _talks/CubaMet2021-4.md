# Abstact
A sensitivity study is performed with Lin, Morrison 2-moment, WSM5,
and WSM6 microphysics schemes for the numerical forecast of the low-level
wind shear derived from storms at "José MartíÏnternational Airport using
the Weather Research and Forecasting model. As case studies, we select four
storms associated with synoptic patterns that cause dangerous conditions at
this aerodrome. The simulations are made for several atmosphere low levels.
The influence of obstacles of comparable height with the atmospheric low-levels
was taken into account to obtain the wind fields with mass consistent correction.
In this paper, the evaluation process is focus on precipitation. The schemes
did not show bigger diferences among themselves. The best performance for
precipitation forecast was obtained with WSM5 in rainy season (May-October)
and Lin in dry season (November-April). Also, WSM5 and Lin show advantage
in Pearson correlation coefficient between the wind shear speed in the 0-2000 ft
layer obtained from the Air Force Weather Agency-diagnostics module and the
calculated in this investigation. For LLWS sensitivity, results indicate that each
hydrometeor particle concentration predicted by tested microphysics has an
influence on vertical wind profiles, particularly, for low-levels. The comparative
analysis with Rapid Refresh model analysis data shows that the numerical
LLWS forecast is a strongly dependent on spatial resolution, physics options
and domain extension. WSM5 and Lin seems the best options for microphysics
scheme, although that is not conclusive.
