# Abstact
In this study is evaluated the feasibility of applying a vortex relocation
scheme based on a synthetic vortex in the Numerical Tools for Hurricane
Forecast (NTHF) system. For this, the hurricanes Dorian and Lorenzo, as well
as the tropical storm Karen were selected as case studies. In the experiments
carried out, it was found that the vortex relocation scheme represents a more
structured tropical cyclone (TCs), although the dynamic instability caused by
the introduction of the synthetic vortex in the background eld conditioned that
the center of the TCs developed in a drier environment and the center of the
system were colder, which led to an increase of the mean errors in the track and
intensity forecast, with respect to the experiments without vortex relocation.
