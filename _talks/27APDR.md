Global warming has led to an increase in sea surface temperature (SST), which combined with other factors creates ideal
conditions for the formation of tropical cyclones (TCs). A trend analysis of the sea surface temperatures using the
Centennial Time Scale (COBE SST2) dataset from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), revealed
a tendency towards the warming of the tropical North Atlantic basin (NATL) of approximately 0.0041 oC/year for the
hurricane season (June-November) from 1850 to the end of 2018. In agreement, and despite the uncertainty in the initial
records of tropical cyclones, a trend analysis of the number of TCs computed using statistics from the HURDAT2 database
of the National Hurricane Center reveals an increase in the genesis of TCs in NATL of approximately 7.4 TCs/decade. Also,
the number of systems that reached the category of tropical storm has increased, however, the increase observed in
hurricanes is not significant. Finally, our results confirm previous findings that observed a poleward migration in the
average latitude at which tropical cyclones have achieved their lifetime-maximum intensity over the NATL basin.
Therefore, special attention must be paid to possible observed and future implications of the poleward migration of the
destructive effects of TCs on western Europe.
