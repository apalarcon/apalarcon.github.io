# Abstract
Atmospheric Rivers (AR) are known as narrow and long (> 2000 km) corridors of water vapor. These represent
more than 90% of the meridional transport of moisture and latent heat associated with storm tracks in the
extratropics. In the context of climate change, the water-holding capacity of the atmosphere is projected to
increase by approximately 7% K-1 in the lower troposphere which results in future changes in moisture sources
contributing to moisture transported by ARs to higher latitudes toward the end of the 21st century. Simulations of
the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW) model forced with the Community Earth System Model
(CESM2) and the FLEXPART-WRF model forced with the WRF-ARW outputs are used to determine these changes.
The analysis was carried out mainly by determining the moisture uptake anomaly for the mid-century (MC, 2049-
2053) and end-of-century (EC, 2096-2100) periods, considering the annual and seasonal changes of the variable.
