# Abstact
The short-term prediction of precipitation is a difficult spatio-temporal task due to the
non-uniform characterization of meteorological structures over time. Currently, neural networks such
as convolutional LSTM have shown ability for the spatio-temporal prediction of complex problems.
In this research, we propose an LSTM convolutional neural network (CNN-LSTM) architecture for
immediate prediction of various short-term precipitation events using satellite data. The CNN-LSTM
is trained with NASA Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) precipitation data sets, each at
30-min intervals. The trained neural network model is used to predict the sixteenth precipitation
data of the corresponding fifteen precipitation sequence and up to a time interval of 180 min. The
results show that the increase in the number of layers, as well as in the amount of data in the training
data set, improves the quality of the forecast.
