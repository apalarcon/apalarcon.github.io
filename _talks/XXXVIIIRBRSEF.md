Tropical cyclones (TCs) not only produce heavy rainfall in tropical latitudes but also in mid-latitudes. In this work, we investigated the moisture
sources for the precipitation of TCs in each basin, namely the North Atlantic Ocean (NATL), Central and East Pacific Ocean (NEPAC), Western North
Pacific Ocean (WNP), South Pacific Ocean (SPO), North Indian Ocean (NIO) and South Indian Ocean (SIO). To do this, we applied the Lagrangian moisture 
source diagnostic method and implemented in the TRansport Of water VApor (TROVA) tool to the trajectories of all air parcels that precipitated over 
the TCs location. The pathways of atmospheric parcels were from the global outputs of the FLEXPART model. Meanwhile, the National Hurricane Center 
and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center provided the 6-hourly information of all TCs through the best track archives. Our results revealed that the
moisture often came from ocean sources. Nevertheless, the Central America and Indian Peninsula terrestrial sources played an important role in 
supplying moisture for TCs over the NEPAC and NIO basins, respectively. In summary, the contributions from the western NATL, the Caribbean Sea and 
the Gulf of Mexico accounted for ~91% of moisture in the NATL basin. In NEPAC, the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and Central America mainland 
supplied ~92% of total moisture, while the western North Pacific Ocean, the Philippine Sea and the South China Sea contributed ~90% in WNP. The
Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Peninsula supported approximately 95% of moisture in the NIO basin. Most of the moisture (~91) that 
precipitated over the TCs location in the SIO basin was supplied from the tropical Indian Ocean, while the Coral Sea and the western SPO provided 
substantial moisture (~91%) for the precipitation of TCs in the SPO basin.
