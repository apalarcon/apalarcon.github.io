#Abstract

The solar power installed capacity has experienced signicant development in the last years worldwide. The irradiance is 
the essential variable to produce solar power, although the temperature plays
an essential role too in the eciency of a solar installation. The Atacama desert in South America is
one of the regions on our planet with some of the greatest irradiance levels; thus, its solar power 
installed capacity has experienced a signicant boost in the last ten years. One of the keys to improving
the protability and the eciency of a solar installation is to know the future power generation. For
example, such knowledge lets to make appropriate geographical choices of the areas to be exploited.
In this work, we analysed variations in photovoltaic (PV) generation in the Atacama desert during
the period 2021-2060 by means of an ensemble of three regional climate models from the CORDEX
project. We validated the accuracy of these simulations by comparing them with data from the ERA5
reanalysis. The results show that for 2021-2060 the number of days with high-temperature values will
increase compared to 1980-2005. For the case of irradiance, the number of days with high values will
decrease; meanwhile, low irradiance days will increase, especially for the period 2041-2060. Overall,
a decrease in PV generation is projected along the period studied (higher for (2041-2060)). The
changes in the distribution of temperatures are expected to be the main responsible for reducing PV
generation.
