# Abstract
In this study, we characterize the moisture transport from the Mediterranean Sea (MS) and the North Atlantic
Ocean (NATL) that contributes to the precipitation over Europe, and particularly the Iberian Peninsula, during
WeMO positive (WeMO+) and negative (WeMO-) phases. The Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model
(FLEXPART) was employed to track forward in time the air masses residing over the oceanic basins and compute
their contribution to precipitation over Europe. Our findings confirmed, in agreement with previous studies, that
precipitation increases over the southern half of the Iberian Peninsula during WeMO-, and the opposite occurs
during the positive phase. The Lagrangian experiment also indicated that the WeMO- increased the moisture
contribution from the MS to precipitation over the southeast of Spain, and the western south coast of France,
Corsica and Sardinia. In contrast, decreased towards the Balkans and Eastern Europe. Under positive WeMO the
opposite pattern is observed.
