# Abstract

The hybrid cyclones formed over the Mediterranean Sea, known as Mediterranean hurricanes (medicanes) or
tropical-like cyclones (TLCs), are responsible for hazardous consequences in this region. Remote sources for the
precipitation of medicanes are a open question in the medcyclones field. This work aims to asses the origin of the
precipitation produced by TLCs through a Lagrangian approach based on the analysis of moisture sources for the TLC
Qendresa from 6 to 9 November 2014.
We used the global outputs of the FLEXPART model fed by the ERA-5 reanalysis for backtracked the pathways of
precipitating particles within the outer radius of the storm up to 10 days. We pinpointed the overall large-scale
conditions for the genesis of Qendresa. We found that the moist air parcels described trajectories bordering the
extension through the mid-troposphere linked to a branch of a polar jet stream over southwestern Europe. In
addition , we amassed the total contribution from moisture sources. In this direction, we highlighted that the
atmospheric humidity mainly came from local sources, and the contributions from oceanic (terrestrial) origin
represented 62% (38%) of the total moisture gained by the storm. Future studies will focus on a climatological
analysis of the origin of rainfall produced by these hybrid cyclones.
