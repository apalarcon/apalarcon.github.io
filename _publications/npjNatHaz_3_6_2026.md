# Abstract

The role of atmospheric rivers (ARs) in 119 major flood events across 50 global river basins was investigated. The ARs were linked to 74% of the flood areas and 89% of the full basins. Their contributions were evident during and before floods, with influences spanning mid-latitudes to tropical regions, causing human fatalities and population displacements. These findings underscore ARs as dominant and widespread drivers of extreme flood events worldwide.
