# Abstract

This study assessed five well-established physics suites of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in operational 
forecasting systems in the North Atlantic (NATL) basin or from previous sensitive experiments for dynamic downscaling tropical
cyclone (TC) activity. We performed long-term simulations for the 2020 TC season in the NATL and compared the WRF tracks
against the HURDAT2 dataset from the US National Hurricane Center. Among the tested configurations, the analysis revealed
that the Kain-Fritsch, Purdue Lin, BouLac and revised MM5 schemes for cumulus, microphysics, planetary boundary layer and 
surface layer, respectively (hereafter WT), outperformed all four others in terms of TC frequency, track density and
intensity and showed good performance in the cyclone accumulated energy and TC landfalling locations. In addition, WT 
well-captured the spatial distribution of accumulated TC precipitation and moisture uptake patterns, although it 
overestimated the precipitation maxima. Likewise, it agreed on the relative moisture contribution from fixed moisture 
sources (i.e., Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, tropical NATL, and western NATL) in the NATL basin. Overall, this study 
highlighted the high potential of using the WT physics suite in WRF for downscaling TC activity over the NATL basin,
which will be useful for TC Lagrangian moisture sources analysis in future climate.
