# Abstract

LATTIN is a Python-based tool for Lagrangian atmospheric moisture and heat tracking. It can read input data from the Lagrangian FLEXPART and FLEXPART-WRF models. Features include parallel 
reading of atmospheric parcel trajectories and user custom threshold criteria. It complements and improves existing tools by including several tracking approaches and also by its non-dependence 
on the horizontal resolution of the input or output grid. LATTIN provides a compact tool for Lagrangian atmospheric moisture and heat tracking, which will support a wide range of research to
understand future changes in the hydrological cycle and extreme temperature events.
