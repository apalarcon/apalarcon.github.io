# Abstract

A method for calculating the minimum central pressure in a model of potential intensity of tropical cyclones determined
from the Willoughby wind profile, which provides a physically direct relationship between the central minimum pres-
sure and the maximum wind speed in the surface is proposed. It was observed that the model for the most intense hurri-
canes of the Atlantic basin maintained an uncertainty of a maximum value of 6 hPa. Values of pressure very close to the
reality were noticed. It was checked the ability to simulate the minimum central pressure and the maximum surface
wind speed for less intense hurricanes within very close range to the actual values.

<b>Keywords</b>:  tropical cyclones, wind profile, central minimum pressure, potential hurricane intensity.
