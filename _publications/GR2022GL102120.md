# Abstract

In this study, we investigated the changes in the origin of moisture for the precipitation associated with tropical cyclones (TCs) after extratropical 
transition (ET) over the North Atlantic Ocean (NATL) basin from 1980 to 2018. We analysed the 24 hours before and after the occurrence of ET events.
By applying a TC-centric methodology we found that the moisture uptake occurred predominantly in the south and southwest sectors within ∼2000 km of 
TC centre before ET and from the southwest and west sectors after ET. In addition, the development of the cold front and the warm conveyor belt after
ET induces changes in the moisture transport pattern. Overall, the secondary circulation of TCs favoured the moisture flux inward for TCs precipitation,
while the large-scale baroclinic environment controlled the moisture uptake after ET.
