# Abstract

The tropical cyclones (TCs) trajectories are mainly controlled by the large-scale parameters related with the
steering flow. We used the HURDAT2 database from 1980 to 2018 for grouping the tracks of TCs formed
in the North Atlantic (NATL) main development region into straight moving (SM), recurving landfall
(RCL) and recurving ocean (RCO). Based on this classification, we investigated the changes in the moisture
sources' contributions to the precipitation along the TCs trajectories for each track category by applying a
Lagrangian moisture source diagnostic method to the air parcels pathways from the FLEXPART model.
The highest moisture contribution occurred within 3-5° from the average TCs trajectories. The
moisture supplied from the Gulf of Mexico represented 19.1% of humidity gained by SM but was negligible
for recurving TCs. Likewise, the Caribbean Sea contributed 31.8% for SM, and its humidity support
notably decreased for recurving storms to 0.9–8.3%. In addition, the moisture uptake from the tropical
NATL was similar for all track types. The western NATL increased the moisture supply from 15.3% for SM
to 31.1% for RCO and 42.6% for RCL, while the eastern subtropical NATL provided 3.1% of moisture to
SM, 12.5% to RCL and 45.4% to RCO. It was also notable the moisture support from the terrestrial source
southeastern United States (5.3%) for RCL tracks. Furthermore, we found that El Niño–Southern
Oscillation, the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and the Atlantic Meridional
Mode influence the moisture contributions variability from sources for each track type.
