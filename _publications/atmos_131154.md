# Abstract

 On 12–15 March 1993, a severe winter storm (SC93) formed over the Gulf of Mexico,
affecting the Caribbean Islands and the eastern coast of the United States (US) and Canada with
a notable amount of precipitation, snow and severe local storms. In this study, we investigate the
origin of the precipitation generated by SC93 by applying a widely used Lagrangian moisture source
diagnostic method. Our findings revealed that most of the moisture came from the western North
Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Moreover, the eastern US and Mexico acted
as notable terrestrial moisture sources. Overall, the moisture contribution from the oceanic origin
was higher than the terrestrial counterpart, and the moisture sources progressively shifted northward
as the storm moved. In addition, the moisture uptake mainly occurred in the cyclone–anticyclone
interaction region.
