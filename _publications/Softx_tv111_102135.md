# Abstract

TROVA is a software tool implemented in Fortran and Python focused on the study of moisture sources and sinks using the main Lagrangian methodologies found in the literature. In this upgraded version 1.1.1, the following aspects have been improved: 1) the ability to be installed as a Python package in an Anaconda environment with an improved configuration description, 2) the option to study moisture sources and sinks in different layers of the atmospheric vertical column, 3) the inclusion of an adjustable tracking time for the particles along their trajectories, and 4) the calculation of the water vapor residence time in the atmosphere for all particles over a target region. These updates allow the study and characterization of moisture transport for different extreme events and climatological periods.
