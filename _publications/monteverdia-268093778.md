# Abstract

The knowledge of temporal distribution patterns of rainfall generated by tropical cyclones is an
essential element for the anticipation and confrontation of hydrological disasters of all kinds,
providing an appropriate technical and theoretical basis to support decision making in each
territory. In the present research by processing the precipitation outputs of the atmospheric
Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF), a procedure is designed and applied to
determine the standardized patterns of the respective mass curves and hyetographs, distributed
geographically in Cuba. The results obtained accurately reflected the aspects that influence the
rainfalls of these organisms as they pass through each of the established regions of the country.
