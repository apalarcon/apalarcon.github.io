# Abstract

This work presents a Lagrangian tropical cyclone (TC) precipitation estimates and moisture sources (LagTCPMoS) dataset in the North Atlantic basin from 1980 to 2023. TC tracks were obtained from the U.S. National Hurricane Center HURDAT2 dataset, and the Lagrangian precipitation estimates and moisture sources were computed by applying a Lagrangian moisture tracking approach to the global outputs of the FLEXible PARTicle (FLEXPART v10.4) dispersion model. The LagTCPMoS dataset has two main products for each 6-hourly track point along the TC tracks: the precipitation estimates over a fixed and symmetrical radius of 500 km and the spatial distribution of the origin of moisture for that precipitation at 0.5° × 0.5° grid spacing. We presented an overall assessment and the validation of the Hurricane Harvey (2017) case against the high-resolution Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) dataset to illustrate that both the Lagrangian precipitation estimates and moisture uptake are well captured.
