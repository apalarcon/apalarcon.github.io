# Abstract

The Atacama desert is a region with exceptional conditions for solar power production. However, despite its relevance, the impact of climate change on this resource
in this region has barely been studied. Here, we use regional climate models to explore how climate change will affect the photovoltaic solar power resource per square meter
(PVres) in Atacama.

Models project average reductions in PVres of 1.5% and 1.7% under an RCP8.5 scenario, respectively, for 2021-2040 and 2041-2060. Under RCP2.6 and the same periods,
reductions range between 1.2% and 0.5%. Also, we study the contribution to future changes in PVres of the downwelling shortwave radiation, air temperature and wind velocity. 
We find that the contribution from changes in wind velocity is negligible. Future changes of downwelling shortwave radiation, under the RCP8.5 scenario, cause up to 87% 
of the decrease of PVres for 2021-2040 and 84% for 2041-2060. Rising temperatures due to climate change are responsible for drops in PVres ranging between 13%–19% under RCP2.6 and 
14%–16% under RCP8.5. We conclude that climate change has the potential to impact the PVres in the Atacama region while retaining exceptional conditions for solar power production.
