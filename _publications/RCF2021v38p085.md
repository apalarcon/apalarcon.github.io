# Abstract

A radial pressure profile was incorporated into the HuMPI (Hurricane Maximum Potential Intensity) model 
that guarantees a direct physical relationship between the calculation of the minimum central pressure 
and the maximum potential wind speed. The simulations carried out for Hurricanes Matthew and María show 
that the intensity reached by these systems was approximately 92% of the maximum potential intensity, while the 
intensification of Hurricane Michael very close to the southern coast of the United States, reaching an intensity
slightly higher than the IMP, evidenced the uncertainties in the knowledge of the physical mechanisms that control 
the intensification and weakening processes of tropical cyclones. On the other hand, it was observed that the area 
in which the case studies reached the maximum intensity coincided with the areas estimated by the model and the 
regions with the highest sea surface temperature through which the system moved. In general, the results obtained 
demonstrate the physical consistency of the model to correctly calculate the maximum potential intensity of hurricanes.
