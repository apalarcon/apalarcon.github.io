# Abstract

Moisture transport and changes in the source-sink relationship play a vital role in the atmospheric branch of the hydrological cycle. 
Lagrangian approaches have emerged as the dominant tool to account for estimations of moisture sources and sinks; those that use the FLEXPART
model fed by ERA-Interim reanalysis are most commonly used. With the release of retesting ERA5 higher spatial resolution, it is crucial to 
compare the representation of moisture sources and sinks using the FLEXPART Lagrangian model with different resolutions in the input data,
as well as its version for WRF-ARW input data, the FLEXPART-WRF. In this study, we compare this model for 2014 and moisture sources for the
Iberian Peninsula and moisture sinks of North Atlantic and Mediterranean. For comparison criteria, we considered FLEXPARTv9.0 outputs forced 
by ERA-Interim reanalysis as “control values”. It is concluded that FLEXPARTv10.3 forced with ERA5 data at various horizontal resolutions 
(0.5° and 1°) represents moisture source and sink zones as represented forced by ERA-Interim (1°). In addition, the version fed with the
dynamic downscaling WRF-ARW outputs (∼ 20 km), previously forced with ERA5, also represents these patterns accurately, allowing this tool to 
be used in future investigations at higher resolutions and for regional domains.
