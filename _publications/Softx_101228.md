# Abstract

The TRansport Of water VApor (TROVA) software, developed in Python and Fortran for the study of moisture sources and sinks, is presented here. 
TROVA includes the main Lagrangian methodologies established in the literature, using outputs from the global FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model
and the regional FLEXPART-WRF model at different spatial resolutions. TROVA will benefit users investigating the physics of the atmosphere and 
fields associated with this branch in the study of current and future changes in source–sink moisture relationships and their link with mean and 
extreme precipitation.
