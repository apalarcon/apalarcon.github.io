# Abstract
<b>Introduction</b>: The numerical forecast of tropical cyclones in Cuba is performed through the Short Range Prediction 
System and Numeric Ocean-Atmosphere Forecasting System, but both  systems allow the analysis of tropical cyclones in their
computing domains. <b>Objective</b>: To develop and implement  a model to calculate the potential intensity of tropical 
cyclones considering their thermoenergetic cycle as a generalized Carnot engine and a specific numerical forecasting system
for monitoring tropical cyclones from their genesis. <b>Methods</b>: We modified the classical theory of the potential 
intensity of tropical cyclones and configured the atmospheric component of the Hurricane Weather Research Forecast model
in a new system for its operational run in Cuba. <b>Results</b>: We developed and implemented the Hurricane Maximum Potential
Intensity Model and the Numerical Tools for Hurricane Forecast. <b>Discussion</b>: In the simulations performed with Hurricane
Maximum Potential Intensity, it was shown that the observed values of minimum pressure and maximum winds were similar to the 
simulated values for the most intense hurricanes, and it was detected that the area in which they reached the maximum intensity
coincided with the regions predicted by the model. The track errors of the Numerical Tools for Hurricane Forecast  ranged from
41 km for the first 12 h to 356 km for the 120 h. In particular, the Numerical Tools for Hurricane Forecast showed an ability
to forecast the trajectory of intense hurricanes and the intensity of tropical cyclones from depression to category 3 
hurricanes between 36 and 120 h. Numerical Tools for Hurricane Forecast is skillful for forecasting extreme precipitation 
associated with tropical cyclones in the first 24 h. <b> Conclusions</b>: The systems contribute to the operational forecast
of tropical cyclone activity, the development of new research to improve our knowledge of the dynamic and thermodynamic 
factors that favor the formation and development of tropical cyclones, and its usage for academic purposes.

<b>Keywords</b>: tropical cyclones; numerical forecast; potential intensity; intensity and trajectory
