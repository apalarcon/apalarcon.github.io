# Abstract

The Guanahacabibes Peninsula is a highly vulnerable area to tropical cyclones. The effect
of these meteorological events on the geomorphology of the coasts can affect the nesting
area of sea turtles and therefore their reproductive success. The objectives of this work 
were: to relate the geomorphological changes with the reproductive success of the sea turtles and to determine the
spatial variation of the atmospheric variables during the impact of cyclones. The effect of cyclonic activity on the
inter-annual variation of the number of nests, the distance traveled to nest, the number of nesting attempts and the
hatching success of the hatchlings was analyzed. The value of the variables temperature, pressure and wind force during
the passage of four tropical cyclones was estimated and the effect on sand temperature was evaluated. In addition, a
sampling of the main physical characteristics of "La Barca" beach was carried out, where the distribution of sand was
spatially characterized the year before and after the passage of a meteorological event. Changes in the spatial distribution 
of the physical characteristics of “La Barca” beach were evidenced between the years 2017 and 2019, analyzing their
possible incidence (favorable or unfavorable) on the reproductive success of sea turtles. It was observed that the impact 
of cyclones is more damaging the higher the frequency and intensity. Their passage affects the hatching success of
the hatchlings and the nesting behavior of the females.
