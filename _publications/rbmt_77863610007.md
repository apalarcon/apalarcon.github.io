# Abstract

At the “José Martí” International Airport in Havana (MUHA), the level of accuracy presented by wind direction forecasts is close to 70%,
they do not meet the requirements established by the aeronautical regulations which effectiveness must be higher than 85%. Therefore, a numerical 
forecast of the wind field was implemented at mesoscale, in a short term, using the WRF-NMM and Consistent Mass models that are aimed to improve 
the forecast made by the Ogimet, a wind forecast numerical tool used in the MUHA. It was experimented with different interpolation methods; the best
results were obtained on the natural neighbor with the correction of Consistent Mass model. A computational tool was developed which provided the 
numerical wind field forecasts for the MUHA corresponding to the 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 UTC which have a greater ability than the Ogimet and with 
an effectivity of 91% for numerical forecast of the wind field.
