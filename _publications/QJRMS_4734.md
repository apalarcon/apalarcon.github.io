# Abstract

This study applies a Lagrangian approach to identify the origin of moisture for subtropical cyclones (SCs) along their
tracks in the South Atlantic Ocean (SAO) basin from 1980 to 2015. The analysis shows that the local evaporation cannot 
fully explain the moisture gained by SCs, highlighting the role of external sources in moisture support, mainly through 
the northeasterly winds associated with the South Atlantic Subtropical Anticyclone. Overall, the northwestern SAO was the 
principal moisture source for SCs. It was noticeable that its contribution (~40%–45%) remained quasi-constant during the 
year. Conversely, the moisture supplied from the northeastern SAO, southwestern SAO and the terrestrial source southeastern 
Brazil exhibited a marked seasonal variability. While contributions from the southwestern SAO intensify (weaken) in austral 
winter (summer), the southeastern Brazil source is more intense (weak) in summer (winter). In addition, SCs predominantly 
gain atmospheric humidity from sources close to their position, which reduces the mean water vapor residence time to ~3.2 days. Interestingly, we also found that ~42%–47% of the moisture that reached the SCs precipitates. These findings constitute a further step toward improving our knowledge of mechanisms underlying SC activity in the SAO basin.
