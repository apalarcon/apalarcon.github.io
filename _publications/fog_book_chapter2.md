# Abstract

Fog is a complex atmospheric phenomenon with significant implications for air quality, transportation systems, ecosystems, human health, and weather prediction. This chapter offers a comprehensive overview of various types of fog, delving into the physical and dynamic processes that influence its formation, development, and dissipation. The analysis focuses on key factors, including microphysics, condensation nuclei, synoptic conditions, and surface-atmosphere interactions. Besides, this chapter explores state-of-the-art forecasting techniques and detection methods, emphasizing recent advancements in numerical modelling, satellite remote sensing, and artificial intelligence applications. Additionally, it discusses the various findings regarding fog trends around the world. It also critically examines the challenges in fog forecasting, highlighting the need for improved models capable of capturing its intricate physical processes. Furthermore, the growing impact of climate change and urbanization on fog formation and behaviour is addressed. This chapter also underscores the significance of integrating new technologies and methodologies to enhance understanding and prediction capabilities, providing a valuable resource for advancing fog research and its practical applications.
